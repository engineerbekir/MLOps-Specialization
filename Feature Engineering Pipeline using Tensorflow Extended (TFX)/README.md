# What is The TensorFlow Extended (TFX)

  - [Tensorflow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) is an end-to-end machine learning (ML) platform developed by Google that is designed to facilitate the development and deployment of production-ready machine learning models. TFX provides a set of tools, libraries, and best practices for building scalable and robust machine learning pipelines. These pipelines are used for various tasks in the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
  
  - TFX addresses the challenges of deploying machine learning models in real-world, production environments, where considerations such as data validation, model validation, versioning, and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are crucial. It is often used in scenarios where maintaining and monitoring machine learning models over time is essential.
  
  - Key components and features of TFX include in feature engineering:
  
  1. ExampleGen: Data ingestion and validation.
  2. StatisticsGen: Data analysis and feature engineering.
  3. SchemaGen: Schema inference for data validation.
  4. ExampleValidator: Data validation against a schema.
  5. Transform: Feature engineering and data preprocessing.
  
  TFX is designed to work seamlessly with TensorFlow and is often used in conjunction with other Google Cloud services to create scalable and reproducible machine learning pipelines. It helps organizations automate and streamline their ML operations, enabling them to maintain and update machine learning models with confidence in a production environment.
